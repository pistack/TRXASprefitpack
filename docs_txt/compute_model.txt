compute_model(t, eigval, V, c):

    Compute solution of the system of rate equations solved by solve_model

    input
    t: time numpy 1d array (n,)
    eigval: eigenvalue for equation
    V: eigenvectors for equation
    c: coefficient
    Note: eigval, V, c should be obtained from solve_model

    output
    y: solution of rate equation derived by our model
    numpy 2d array shape: (num_species,n)
