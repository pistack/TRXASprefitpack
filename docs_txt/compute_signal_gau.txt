compute_signal_gau(t, fwhm, eigval, V, c):

    Compute solution of the system of 1st order rate equation convolved with 
    normalized gaussian distribution

    input
    t: time numpy 1d array (n,)
    fwhm: fwhm of x-ray temporal pulse
    eigval: eigenvalue for equation
    V: eigenvectors for equation
    c: coefficient
    Note: eigval, V, c should be obtained from solve_model

    output
    y_signal : convolution of y and IRF
    numpy 2d array shape: (num_species,n)

    We assume temporal pulse of x-ray is normalized gaussian distribution
    sigma = fwhm/(2*sqrt(2*ln(2)))
    IRF(t) = 1/(sigma*sqrt(2*pi))*exp(-t**2/2*sigma**2)
