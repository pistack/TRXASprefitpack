compute_signal_cauchy(t, fwhm, eigval, V, c):

    Compute solution of the system of 1st order rate equation convolved with
    normalized cauchy distribution

    input    
    t: time numpy 1d array (n,)
    fwhm: fwhm of x-ray temporal pulse
    eigval: eigenvalue for equation
    V: eigenvectors for equation
    c: coefficient
    Note: eigval, V, c should be obtained from solve_model

    output
    y_signal : convolution of y and IRF
    numpy 2d array shape: (num_species,n)

    We assume temporal pulse of x-ray is normalized cauchy distribution
    gamma = fwhm/2
    IRF(t) = gamma/pi*1/((x-t)**2+gamma**2)
