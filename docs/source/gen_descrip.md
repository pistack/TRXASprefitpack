# General Description

Utilites of ``TRXASprefitpack`` package

* Match Utility

  1. match_scale: Corrects the scaling of each energy scan data to one reference time delay scan data

* Calc Utility

  1. calc_broad: broaden theoretically calculated line shape spectrum with voigt profile
  2. calc_dads: Calculates decay associated difference spectrum from experimental energy scan and sum of exponential decay model
  3. calc_sads: Calculates species associated difference spectrum frim experimental energy scan and 1st order rate equation model

* Fit Utility

  1. fit_static: fits sum of voigt component or voigt broadend theoretical spectrum with experimental static spectrum.
  2. fit_tscan: Find lifetime constants of experimental time trace spectrum
